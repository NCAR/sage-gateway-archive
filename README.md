The SAGE gateway repository running ESG and ACADIS

The Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS) is a joint effort by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), UNIDATA, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to provide data archival, preservation and access for all projects funded by NSF's Arctic Science Program (ARC). ACADIS builds on the CADIS project that supported the Arctic Observing Network (AON). This portal will continue to be a gateway for AON data and is being expanded to include all NSF ARC data.

The ACADIS Gateway was funded by the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS) through National Science Foundation (NSF) Award number 1016034.
