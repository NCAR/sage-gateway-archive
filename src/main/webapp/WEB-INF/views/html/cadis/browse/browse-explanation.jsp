						<p>To search for data using more narrowly defined variables, either:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Use a keyword in the "Search ACADIS Data" text box (e.g. "ice thickness") at the top of any page</li>
							<li>Go to the <a href='<c:url value="/search.html"/>'>Search for Data page</a> to search, e.g., for variable "Cryosphere > sea ice > ice thickness"</li>
						</ol>
						<p>These methods will, of course, give different results.</p>
						
						<br />
						<p>Each category folder at left contains ONLY the projects and 
						associated data sets for that category. General project descriptions, 
						PI information, and data set descriptions can also be found 
						within these folders.</p>
						
						<p>Supporting Data Sets is a category that will grow to contain
						 data that may be widely useful for AON and SEARCH.</p>
						 
						 <p>For now (Fall 2009) CADIS data organization follows NSF's AON 
						 project organization:  The <b><i>NSF grant number</i></b> is identified with 
						 a lead PI and that grant's <b><i>PI</i></b> can upload data to CADIS (or can 
						 authorize someone to do so).  Each grant belongs to a <b><i>project</i></b>.  
						 A project may have more than one contributing grant.  Each project 
						 has a title, and the project's title is identical to the title 
						 of the AON grant(s). Each project is a member of one of the 
						 <b><i>SEARCH categories or disciplines</i></b>.  PIs or assignees can upload 
						 <b><i>data sets</i></b> to CADIS.  The PI or assignee decides how to organize 
						 the data set, and provides standard metadata using the CADIS 
						 metadata authoring interface.</p>
