        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>The only information that UCAR obtains about a user to its Site is information supplied voluntarily
            by the user. This means that you can visit the UCAR Site without identifying who you are or
            revealing any information about yourself. In order to serve you better, meet UCAR's goals, reporting
            requirements and gauge the effectiveness of the Site, UCAR collects some general information about
            its users which does not individually identify anyone by email address or otherwise. Therefore,
            information about which pages a user visits, where and how a user links to the Web page, how much
            time is spent on each page, how many times a new user accesses the Web page, and the date and time
            of the visit, is automatically tracked in the aggregate. Some UCAR programs or services may request
            specific user information, such as name and email address, and the user may decide whether to
            voluntarily supply that information. For more information on UCAR's privacy policy see <a

        <h3>NOTIFICATION OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT</h3>
        <p>UCAR will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate the accounts of users who infringe the
            intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your work has been used or copied in a
            way that constitutes copyright infringement and such infringement is occurring on this Site or on
            sites linked to or from this Site, please provide UCAR's Copyright Agent a Copyright Infringement
            Notification. Subscribers who feel that an infringement notification has been filed in error may

        <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act requires that all notices of alleged copyright infringement be
            in writing. For UCAR to act on your notice, you must be authorized to enforce the copyrights that

        <p>(5) Certify that the information that you have provided UCAR is accurate. You should attest under
